# Image Captioning with YOLO Backbone, BERT Tokenizer, and LSTM

## Introduction

This project aims to develop an image captioning model that utilizes YOLO (You Only Look Once) as a backbone for feature extraction from images. After extracting features, we employ the BERT tokenizer to encode text and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to generate captions for the images.

## Directory Structure

- `Feature_extractors/`: Contains the source code for feature extraction from images.
- `Test_model/`: Contains the source code for testing the model.
- `Build_model/`: Contains trained models.

## Installation

Before running the code, ensure that you have installed the necessary libraries. You can install them using pip:

## Usage

1. **Feature Extraction**: Use YOLO to extract features from images. The code for this can be found in `Feature_extractors/220k-gpt4-features-10000.ipynb`.

2. **Text Encoding**: Utilize the BERT tokenizer to encode text captions. This helps convert text into vectors that the model can understand.

3. **Caption Generation**: Use LSTM to generate captions for images based on the extracted features and encoded text vectors.

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the code to extract features and generate captions for an image:

## Conclusion

This project combines modern technologies in deep learning to create an effective image captioning model. We hope that this code and guide will assist you in developing and improving your own models.
